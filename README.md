### Target Users
CS Students who study programming through Youtube
(About 200 thousand student graduate per year in the USA)

### How to solve the problem
**Problem:** <br>
Many Computer Science majoring students learn programming language and techniques through the youtube platform. However, to take a note, the student may use extra notes on his or her desk or may use another note-taking application while they are watching the lecture through youtube. If the student has to switch his or her screen very often to take a note, it may interfere with concentration.

**Solution:** <br>
add note and video in one screen, so the student does not have to switch their screen to take note. Users can adjust the video size for a comfortable note-taking environment. They can watch and write a note at once in the same window.


### Competitors
* [**Rocket Notes**](https://getrocketnote.com/)
	* Google Extension Application. 
	* Not too friendly for taking notes.
	* If you switch to the screen-mode on Youtube, the note disappears to the bottom.
	* The system looks like a prototype and it requires the payment after 30 days use.

* [**Youtube Notes**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-notes/ioigabfnnlpmpojagfikdodkkdogmpih?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)
	* Chrome Browser Extension for Writing and managing notes for YouTube videos.
	* Create fixed size notepad from the chrome extension bar
	* The size of the notepad cannot be changed.
	* There are no features to make font changeable.
	* Only be able to see notes in the application. We cannot export this note to any other format of the file.

* [**Gnotes**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnotes/idpclaojcopihmplcfnmgfkllldpajen) 
	* A web app and chrome extension to take notes on YouTube videos. It helps people create documents better suited for consuming information on the go. 
	* People should paste a YouTube link to see a video (but an error occurs). 
	* Users cannot write a document and watch a video at once. Users need to scroll down to write a document. 


### Plans for survey or interview
* Survey computer science students in SUNY Korea and ask how many of them are using youtube as a learning platform.
* Ask have they ever faced difficulties while learning through Youtube. (Screen being too small if you put on other programs to take notes or to code.)
